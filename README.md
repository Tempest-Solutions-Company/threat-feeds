## 🛡️ Ethical Threat Feeds — By Devs, For Devs

A transparent, community-first repository of curated **threat feeds** in `.txt`, `.cvs`, and `.json` formats. Built from real-world firewall logs and IDS/IPS alerts from our network, these datasets help sysadmins defend their networks with actionable, ethically-sourced data. Each feed includes timestamps, offense counts, and traffic metadata—supporting responsible threat sharing and collaborative defense.

Github Pages - [Intelegence feed](https://tempest-solutions-company.github.io/threat-feeds/)

### 📅 Update Frequency

Threat files are refreshed every **30 minutes**, ensuring timely access to active indicators of compromise.


### 📁 Published Threat Feeds

We prioritize the most common and impactful threats, with lesser-known patterns placed in an **uncategorized** catch-all.  
Structured blocklists are maintained across distinct malicious behavior categories:

- **Compromised Hosts**  
- **Port Scanners**  
- **Targeted Attackers**  
- **TOR Exit Nodes**  
- **High Offense IPs**  
- **Uncategorized Threats**  (**Catch all other threats**)

Each feed includes offense counts, first/last seen timestamps, threat signatures, and country of origin when available.

**Available formats:**
- `.txt`: Pipe-delimited, human-readable  
- `.csv`: Tab-delimited, ideal for automation  
- `.json`: Schema-based for direct parsing and enrichment


### 🧭 Ethics & Transparency

We believe responsible sharing is key to sustainable cybersecurity:

- Feeds are built solely from confirmed malicious activity  
- CGNAT awareness and de-duplication help reduce false positives  
- **No personal or non-malicious traffic is ever included**  
- We avoid tracking user-identifiable data and follow responsible disclosure practices


### 💡 Use Cases

- Blocklisting malicious IPs at the firewall or WAF level  
- Enriching SIEM/SOAR intelligence pipelines  
- Powering anomaly detection and machine learning models  
- Researching threat trends across geography and ASN
